# United Tea Traders — local development

This repository contains a small Next.js App Router site using Tailwind CSS. The main page is at `src/app/page.jsx` and expects images in `public/`.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16.8 or later) and npm installed on your machine.
- A terminal (PowerShell on Windows is fine).

Install and run (PowerShell)
```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\Itsab\Downloads\United Tea Traders'
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default.

If npm is not available
- Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ (LTS recommended). After installing, reopen PowerShell and re-run `npm install`.

Notes / troubleshooting
- You may see editor warnings in `src/app/globals.css` about `@tailwind` or `@apply`. These are PostCSS/Tailwind directives and will be processed when you run the build.
- If you want the exact `bg-cream-50` color, tell me the hex value and I will add it to `tailwind.config.js` under `theme.extend.colors`.

Files of interest
- `src/app/page.jsx` — Main page (the code you provided)
- `src/app/globals.css` — Tailwind CSS entry
- `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` — Tailwind setup
